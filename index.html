We provide both online & offline legal consultancy across Delhi-NCR and the whole Ghaziabad area. We handle matters for builders, individuals, and agencies.

          <div class="service">
            <h3>Real Estate & Property Verification</h3>
            <p>We perform complete property verification including title checks, encumbrance certificate review, mutation history and chain of ownership scrutiny. Our team inspects documents like sale deeds, construction documents, and previous title papers to ensure a clean title. We provide a written Property Search Report with identified risks and recommended remedies. We coordinate with local registrars and municipal records for verified information. Our advice helps buyers and builders avoid legal disputes before property transactions. We also conduct on-site property status verification to ensure there are no physical disputes, possession conflicts, or unauthorized constructions. Our verification process includes checking litigation records in district courts and revenue offices to confirm that the property is free from ongoing court cases. This comprehensive due-diligence ensures complete transparency and protects clients from future legal and financial risks.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- service 2 -->
          <div class="service">
            <h3>Divorce & Family Law</h3>
            <p>We counsel clients on matrimonial disputes, divorce petitions, maintenance claims, and child custody arrangements with empathy and legal precision. Our approach emphasizes negotiated settlements where possible, and robust litigation when necessary. We draft petitions, counter-petitions, and agreements, and represent clients in family courts across Delhi-NCR. We guide clients about legal rights, timelines and probable outcomes realistically. Confidentiality and client-centered strategy are central to our family law practice.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- service 3 -->
          <div class="service">
            <h3>Banking, Loan & RERA Matters</h3>
            <p>We assist clients with bank disputes, loan documentation, recovery notices and compliance issues arising from lenders. We handle matters under RERA — including builder disputes, project registration, consumer claims and compensation matters. We prepare and file statutory replies, complaints, and appeals before regulatory authorities and tribunals. We represent buyers and builders in negotiations and hearings with banks and RERA authorities. Our experience helps clients achieve enforceable and practical resolutions.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- service 4 -->
          <div class="service">
            <h3>Legal Notices & Replies</h3>
            <p>We draft precise and legally effective legal notices for recovery, breach, eviction, and other disputes with clear facts and legal grounds. We prepare responses to received legal notices, including admissions, denials, and proposed settlements or defences. Notices and replies are drafted to maximize negotiation leverage while preserving litigation options. We also file statutory notices and serve them through appropriate channels, ensuring proof of service. Our notices are crafted to be legally sound and practically persuasive.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- service 5 -->
          <div class="service">
            <h3>Drafting & Pleadings</h3>
            <p>We prepare well-researched and court-ready drafts — plaints, written statements, petitions, appeals, drafting of agreements, and statutory submissions. Each pleading is prepared with legal citations, factual chronology, and tailored reliefs suited to the client’s objective. We ensure procedural compliance and attention to limitation periods, jurisdiction and cause of action. Our drafts aim to present a coherent narrative and strong legal foundation. We also revise and review existing drafts for clients and agencies.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="service">
            <h3>Legal Documentation & Property Transaction Support</h3>
            <p>We handle sale deeds, conveyance, lease and rental agreements, builders’ agreements, and all transaction documentation with meticulous attention to title, encumbrances and stamp duty compliance. Our services include drafting bespoke agreements, verifying vendor credentials, and ensuring registration readiness. We help in regulatory compliance, coordination with revenue & municipal authorities, and in preparing due-diligence packets for lenders or buyers. We also assist builders with project documentation and consumer compliance under RERA. The goal is to make transactions secure and legally clean.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- service 7 -->
          <div class="service">
            <h3>Property Search Report & Due Diligence</h3>
            <p>We prepare comprehensive search reports detailing title history, encumbrances, litigation records, statutory liabilities and pending dues. Our due-diligence includes municipal clearances, land use checks, and verification of seller’s authority to transfer. Each report comes with risk scoring and recommended steps to mitigate identified issues. We explain legal implications in simple terms so clients can make informed decisions. These reports are useful for buyers, banks, and developers before major transactions.</p>
          </div>
